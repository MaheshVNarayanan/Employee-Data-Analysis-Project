# Employee-Data-Analysis-Project
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset provided by ABC Company to gain valuable insights into their employee structure, salary distributions, and other key metrics. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, capturing various employee details such as age, salary, team, position, and height.

The tasks include:

Preprocessing the dataset for consistency and accuracy.
Performing specific analytical tasks to answer business questions.
Visualizing the findings using appropriate charts and graphs.
Preprocessing Steps
Height Column Correction:

The height column contained inconsistent data.
It was replaced with random values ranging from 150 to 180 cm to ensure realistic and consistent height values.
Data Validation:

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers across the dataset.
Standardized column names for uniformity.
Categorical Grouping:

Created meaningful groupings (e.g., age groups) to simplify analysis.
Analysis Tasks
Team Distribution:

Determined the number of employees in each team.
Calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Position Segregation:

Categorized employees based on their positions within the organization.
Predominant Age Group:

Identified the most common age group among employees.
Highest Salary Expenditure:

Found the team and position with the highest total salary expenditure.
Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Investigated the relationship between employee age and salary to check for any patterns or trends.
